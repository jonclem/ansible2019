Readme for the build
1. Download Vagrant as per the Readme and install on your environment
2. Download VirtualBox as a Hypervisor to be used.
3. Look at the vagrant config and make changes to suit your environment.
4. Once the Vm's are built run the .ps1 script on the windows2019 for the winrm service.
5. On the ubuntu box install ansible and make the changes to suit your host.
6. Test connectivity between the ansible control and the windows vm.
7. Then you can copy the ansible playbooks and make changes where necessary to run the playbook.
8. I have tried and tested on my environment numerous times and everything works like a charm.
